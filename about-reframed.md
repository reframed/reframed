#### Why did we run this study?

Depression is an extremely common mental health problem that is most commonly treated with antidepressant drugs. Unfortunately, some people continue to feel depressed even though they have taken antidepressants for a while.


A new type of therapy, called Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO-DBT), was developed to treat these problems. Standard DBT was originally developed to help people with borderline personality disorder or people who harmed themselves. However, newers studies showed that RO-DBT might help people suffering from depression for whom anti-depressants do not seem to help.
